# sentiment_analyzer
This project is a Python-based sentiment analysis model developed by me to predict user sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) from textual data; it focuses on leveraging natural language processing techniques, classification algorithms, using libraries like scikit-learn and pandas, to build and evaluate a logistic regression model.
